- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan Antonov.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in backend development and reverse engineering.  
My favorite stack is .NET (C#) and Java. Also Python deserves my attention for its flexibility and power.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning concurrency and memory management in c# so i'm reading the books "Concurrency in C# cookbook" and "Under the hood of .NET memory management".  
Before that I read "CLR via C#" and "Async in C# 5.0". In the future, I plan to read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications".  
Currently Iâ€™m working on my own public [project](https://github.com/Raleose/Epic.Heroes.War.Hack) as well as my private project (Thank you, [my friend](https://github.com/DmitryXronos)).  
Unfortunately, my private project is hidden from public users because it must not fall into the wrong hands. But you can still check out my public project pinned in my main page.
