- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan Antonov.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in backend development and reverse engineering.  
My favorite stack is .NET (C#) and Java. Also Python deserves my attention for its flexibility and power.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning concurrency and memory management in c# so i'm reading the books "Concurrency in C# cookbook".  
Before that I read "Under the hood of .NET memory management", "CLR via C#" and "Async in C# 5.0". In the future, I plan to read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications".
