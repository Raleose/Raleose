- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan Antonov.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in backend development and reverse ingeneering.  
My favorite stack is .net (c#) and java. Also python deserves my attention for it's flexibility and power.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning concurrency in c# so i'm reading the book "Concurrency in c# cookbook".  
Before that i read "Clr via c#" and "Async in c# 5.0". In the future, I plan to read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications".  
Currently Iâ€™m working on my own public [project](https://github.com/Raleose/Epic.Heroes.War.Hack) as well as my private project.  
Unfortunately my private project is hidden from public users because it must not fall into the wrong hands. But you can still check out my public project pinned in my main page.
